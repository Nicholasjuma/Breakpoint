# Breakpoint
This is class work research about breakpoint and how to use it
How to Use a Breakpoint in This Code
Open the Code in an IDE:

Open this code in your preferred Java IDE, like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
Set a Breakpoint:

Set a breakpoint at the line where sum += calculateSquare(i); is executed within the loop. In most IDEs, you can do this by clicking on the left margin next to the line number where this statement is located.
Start Debugging:

Run the program in debug mode. The IDE will start the program, and it will pause execution when it hits the breakpoint.
Inspect the Program State:

Once the program is paused at the breakpoint, you can inspect the value of i, sum, and the result of calculateSquare(i).
You can then step through the program line by line (using options like "Step Over", "Step Into", or "Step Out") to see how the values change with each iteration of the loop.
Resume Execution:

After inspecting the variables, you can continue running the program until the next breakpoint or until it finishes.
Explanation
Loop Execution: The loop runs from i = 1 to i = 5. During each iteration, it calculates the square of i using the calculateSquare method and adds it to sum.
Breakpoint Utility: By setting a breakpoint at sum += calculateSquare(i);, you can see how the sum variable changes as each square is added.
This simple program is great for understanding how breakpoints can help you debug your code by allowing you to pause execution and inspect how variables are changing.
